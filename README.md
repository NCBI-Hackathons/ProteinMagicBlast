## Pitch
Biologists are interested in studying variation on a protein level. Does a mutation change an amino acid in a protein. Does the changed protein have the same function? SuperMagicBlast answers these questions. All it needs is a list of SRA accessions and Refseq proteins. It reports differences between sequenced mRNAs and provided proteins.

## Introduction
    The purpose of this approach is to provide answers to questions raised by scientific community
    in regard to changes in the protein sequences when compared with SRA data using Magic Blast 
    tool and supporting software. The main question answered is given the genomic sequences if it
    has sequences related with a given protein and also if any changes in protein has occurred. 
    The software will provide the protein alignments and changes in amino acids will be displayed on the viewer.  

## What's the problem? 
    New Translated Magic Blast solves the problem of user when finding relationship of given sequence 
    data with interested proteins. User wants to know if in the new genome(sequences) are interested 
    protein sequences be found? if yes, are there any significant changes related with interested protein? 
    Has the amino acid changed at any of the positions?  

## Why should we solve it? 
   Amino acid point mutations (nsSNPs) may change protein structure and function. 
   The second approach lets us identify the changes and the magnitude may vary depending on how similar or dissimilar
   the replaced amino acids are, as well as on their position in the sequence or the structure.

# How to use <this software>
    In the simplest form Super Magic blast requires only two inputs: PROTEIN Accession and SRR Accession.
    For Example:
    
```
supermagicblast.py -prot_accs NP_066251.1  -srr SRR5150787 
```
    
    The output is standard blastx output in json format
    
## Installation options:

We provide two options for installing <this software>: Docker or directly from Github.

### Docker

The Docker image contains <this software> as well as a webserver and FTP server in case you want to deploy the FTP server. It does also contain a web server for testing the <this software> main website (but should only be used for debug purposes).

1. `docker pull ncbihackathons/<this software>` command to pull the image from the DockerHub
2. `docker run ncbihackathons/<this software>` Run the docker image from the master shell script
3. Edit the configuration files as below

### Installing <this software> from Github

1. `git clone https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/<this software>.git`
2. Edit the configuration files as below
3. `sh server/<this software>.sh` to test
4. Add cron job as required (to execute <this software>.sh script)

### Configuration

```Examples here```

# Testing

We tested four different tools with <this software>. They can be found in [server/tools/](server/tools/) . v

# Additional Functionality

### DockerFile

<this software> comes with a Dockerfile which can be used to build the Docker image.

  1. `git clone https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/<this software>.git`
  2. `cd server`
  3. `docker build --rm -t <this software>/<this software> .`
  4. `docker run -t -i <this software>/<this software>`
  
### Website

There is also a Docker image for hosting the main website. This should only be used for debug purposes.

  1. `git clone https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/<this software>.git`
  2. `cd Website`
  3. `docker build --rm -t <this software>/website .`
  4. `docker run -t -i <this software>/website`
